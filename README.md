# Stegodotgraphy
Basically just a steganography thingy in the Godot engine, vat else. It lets you load an image, store and read hidden messages to it, and save the file. Have fun.

# Why
A certain someone let me know that a classmate was using ChatGPT to write code for their capstone project (ðŸ¤®). I just want to do make my own implementation for my own fun. Also I did it once in Java in highschool and it was kinda fun so I want to do it again in my bread-and-butter language.

## Installation
You shouldn't install this, let alone attempt to run this. It isn't good. It actually quite minimal and useless. Save your time. Make your own.
